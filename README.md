# Creating SciENcv generated NIH biosketch 
Moo K. Chung, March 2, 2025

Any NIH grant proposal after May 2025 should use new SciEncv generated biosketch. SciENcv integrates the Common Forms templates related to NIH notice NOT-OD-24-163 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24-163.html). 

1) First login into NIH eRA Commons http://public.era.nih.gov/commons/commonsInit.do
There are multile ways to login to eCommons. Most common way is to use login.gov (top link in the eCommons website). 

2) Then login into SciENcv using NIH eRA Commons credentials
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/

Then you need to generate a new document using the NIH Biosketch format. 
For Contribution to Science, citations should be linked from either "My Biblography" or ORCID. 
If you did not updated your My Biblography trhough NIH, some citations may not be shown.
